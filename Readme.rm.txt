Looking at what 'status' is for the webdriver. Right now I don't find any utility, but I will keep my get_status method, maybe
in the future it will give me something good.

Made methods for maximize, minimize and full screen for the browser. I think that I need to start documenting code.

At least I could call methods from my webdriver to open, navigate and close browser.

I created a close browser in my sandbox, now it is time to start working on my webdriver class.
Also I think it is time to establish some code conventions, because maybe in the future collaborators could be taken.

I changed my approach, more than threading I am using subrocesses. The next problem that appeared is that the chromedriver is not closed
when the program ended, so I had to see how to close subprocesses. DONE.

Added a navigation function to my sandbox.

Starting to work on my webdriver class, my biggest challenge now is to be able to run the driver on a thread and continue the operations
in another.

Another thing I should start doing is to make this a real project with some management.

Welcome to my automation project.

For now we have just some experimentation buuuut, it will grow.
